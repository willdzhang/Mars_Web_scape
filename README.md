Build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Scraping

Initial scraping with Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

### NASA Mars News

* Scrape [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign text to variables that you can reference later.

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visit url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).

* Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

### Mars Weather

* Visit the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scrape the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Save the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called `mars_weather`.

### Mars Facts

* Visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

## MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.
